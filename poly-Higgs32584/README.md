## Empirical Data Analysis
There are a number of things that this program is supposed to excecute. First, the program desires you to add the polynominals together. The program also desires you to pass the test cases, obviously. There are a number of Key attributes in this equation, the most important being the Terms and the polynominals. The Term equation requires that the first term should be the factor and the second term should be the exponent, or the power the x is raised to. If it is raised to zero, the number is zero. Secondly, the toString method requires you to return the correct value. For example, the ToString of poly one after excecuting poly1.add(new Term(5,2)) should return 5x^2. The Program also requires you to add priority order to the added terms, where Term(5,2), Term(5,0) and Term(5,1) should be sorted when the toString is excecuted is by the highest exponenet. The equation should also allow for the adding, and multiplying of other polynominals.
